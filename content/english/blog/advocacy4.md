## When Detention Has No Name  
*Written during my stay in India*

One of the most terrifying things about persecution is not knowing where it will end. There is no charge, no explanation, and no timeline. You can be taken, held, and forgotten. That uncertainty is what stays with you long after the physical pain fades.

As an Amhara, detention is always a possibility, even when you have done nothing wrong. You do not need to commit a crime. You do not need to speak loudly. Sometimes, your identity alone is enough.

I have seen how people are taken without warrants or explanations. Families wait outside police stations for days, sometimes weeks, just to hear a name or receive confirmation that their loved one is still alive. Often, they receive nothing. Silence becomes the answer.

When I was detained, I realized how fragile life becomes inside those walls. You lose track of time. You lose your sense of dignity. You begin to understand that your safety depends entirely on the mood of those holding power over you. There is no law to protect you when the law itself is being ignored.

What makes detention especially cruel is the fear of disappearance. Many Amhara people are detained and never seen again. No charges. No court. No body. Just absence. Families are left in a permanent state of mourning without closure.

Even after my release, the fear did not leave me. I was constantly alert, constantly listening for footsteps, constantly afraid that someone would come again. Sleep became difficult. Trust became impossible. Freedom felt temporary.

Living in India has given me distance from that immediate danger, but the psychological impact remains. Fear does not respect borders. Memories return unexpectedly. Loud noises, uniforms, or even certain words can bring everything back.

This experience is not unique to me. It is shared by many Amhara families across Ethiopia. Detention has become a tool of intimidation rather than justice. It is used to silence, to frighten, and to break people emotionally.

I write this because detention without reason should never be normal. Fear should never be policy. And disappearance should never be accepted as part of life.

No one should live knowing that they can vanish without explanation.  
No family should beg for information about a loved one’s existence.  
And no identity should make someone a permanent suspect.

This is not just a political issue.  
It is a human one.  
And it continues every day.
