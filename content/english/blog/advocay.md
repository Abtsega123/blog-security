## Being Amhara Is Not a Crime  
*Written during my stay in India*

I am writing this as an Amhara student living in India, far from my home in Ethiopia, but never far from the pain my people are enduring. Distance does not erase responsibility. Silence does not protect us. And being Amhara should never be treated as a crime.

I left Ethiopia to continue my education, hoping that learning and skill-building would give me a better future. But even while studying abroad, my heart has remained in Ethiopia, especially with Amhara civilians who continue to face violence, detention, and systematic persecution simply because of who they are.

Over the past years, reports of arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, destruction of businesses, and killings of Amhara civilians have become painfully common. Families are torn apart. Fathers disappear. Mothers are left without answers. Young people are imprisoned or forced to flee. This is not random violence. This is targeted persecution.

What hurts most is that Amhara people are constantly labeled as enemies of the state. The word “nefxegna” is used to dehumanize us, to justify abuse, and to silence our voices. This dangerous narrative has allowed security forces and authorities to treat Amhara civilians as if they have no rights, no dignity, and no protection under the law.

I strongly oppose this injustice.

Opposing persecution does not mean opposing peace. Demanding accountability does not mean promoting violence. As Amhara students and members of the diaspora, our calls have always been peaceful. We ask for basic human rights: the right to live without fear, the right to own property without it being destroyed, and the right not to be detained or tortured because of ethnicity or political opinion.

While in India, I have joined other Amhara students and community members in peaceful discussions, awareness meetings, and advocacy activities. We organize conversations, share verified information, raise funds for displaced families, and speak openly about what is happening back home. We do this not because we hate our country, but because we love it and want it to be just for all its citizens.

Some accuse us of opposing the government from abroad. If opposing torture, ethnic hatred, and unlawful detention is a crime, then yes, we oppose it. History will not forgive silence in the face of suffering.

The Ethiopian government must understand that repression does not create unity. Fear does not create stability. A country cannot survive by criminalizing an entire ethnic group and treating peaceful dissent as treason.

I write this blog not as a politician, but as a son, a student, and an Amhara who has seen firsthand how persecution destroys lives. My own family has suffered. Businesses have been burned. Loved ones have disappeared. These are not abstract stories to me. They are my reality.

To the international community, I ask you not to look away. To fellow Ethiopians, I ask you to reject ethnic hatred. And to Amhara people everywhere, your voice matters, even when they try to silence it.

We deserve to live.  
We deserve justice.  
And we will continue to speak peacefully, truthfully, and without fear.
