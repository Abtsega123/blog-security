## Living as an Amhara Minority in Wolaita  
*Written during my stay in India*

When people talk about persecution, they often imagine prisons, soldiers, and violence. But before it reaches that point, persecution begins quietly. It begins in everyday life, in how people look at you, how they speak to you, and how they decide whether you belong.

I was born and raised in Wolaita, but I was never truly accepted there. My family is Amhara, and from a young age, I learned that this alone was enough to make us different. We spoke the same national language, lived peacefully, and worked honestly, yet we were always treated as outsiders.

Growing up as an Amhara minority in Wolaita meant living with constant awareness. Awareness of how much you speak, where you go, and how visible you are. People openly called us “nefxegna,” not as a joke, but as a way to remind us that we were unwanted. That word followed us everywhere, in school, in the neighborhood, and even in places where we should have felt safe.

As a child, I did not understand politics. I only understood that I was excluded. Other children avoided us. Teachers knew what was happening but rarely intervened. Over time, exclusion became normal, and fear became quiet and familiar.

As I grew older, the situation worsened. Being Amhara was no longer just a reason for insults. It became a reason for suspicion. Amhara families were watched more closely. Amhara businesses were targeted. My father worked hard for years to build a small supermarket, believing that honest work would protect us. It did not.

When federal forces destroyed our family’s business without any legal reason, I understood something very clearly. We were not being punished for a crime. We were being punished for who we are. Watching our livelihood burn was not just economic loss. It was a message. A message that said we were not safe and never had been.

Living as a minority means knowing that when something goes wrong, there is no protection. There is no authority you can trust. Complaining only brings more danger. Silence becomes a survival strategy.

Even after leaving Ethiopia and coming to India, the memories did not leave me. The fear, the humiliation, and the feeling of being unwanted stayed with me. I began to realize that what I experienced was not isolated. Many Amhara families living as minorities in different regions faced the same reality.

This is why I speak today. Not because I want attention, but because I know what it means to live without protection. I know what it means to watch your family suffer while the law remains silent. I know what it means to be treated as a threat simply because of your identity.

Being a minority should never mean being disposable. Being Amhara should never mean being targeted. No one should have to leave their home to feel human.

I still carry Wolaita with me. It is where I grew up. It is where my memories were formed. But it is also where I learned what persecution feels like before it becomes visible to the world.

This is my truth.  
This is not politics.  
This is lived experience.
