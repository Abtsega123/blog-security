## A Call to Conscience  
*Written during my stay in India*

There comes a moment when witnessing suffering is no longer enough. When awareness alone does not feel sufficient. When silence, even from good people, begins to feel like acceptance. For me, that moment has already passed.

Across Ethiopia, many Amhara families have been displaced from their homes. Some fled violence. Others were forced out after their livelihoods were destroyed. Many are now living without shelter, food security, or protection. These are not statistics. These are parents, children, elders, and students whose lives have been abruptly torn apart.

Displacement does not only take away homes. It takes away dignity, stability, and hope. Families who once supported themselves are now dependent on others for survival. Children who should be in school are instead focused on finding their next meal. This is the reality many are living with every day.

I am writing this to ask people, both inside Ethiopia and in the diaspora, not to turn away. Support does not require wealth or power. It requires humanity and commitment.

Those inside the country can help by protecting one another, by refusing to participate in ethnic hatred, and by standing firm in the belief that no group deserves collective punishment. Small acts of kindness and courage matter more than people realize.

Those outside the country can help by speaking out, by sharing credible information, by supporting humanitarian efforts, and by assisting displaced families through donations, advocacy, or community support. Distance does not remove responsibility. In many cases, it increases it.

Opposing persecution does not mean promoting violence. Helping displaced families does not mean supporting division. Standing firm in your beliefs does not mean abandoning peace. Justice and humanity are not extremist positions. They are moral ones.

I know that fear keeps many people silent. I understand that speaking comes with risks. But history shows us that injustice grows strongest when it is left unchallenged. Silence allows suffering to continue unnoticed.

I ask those who still believe in human dignity to remain firm. To resist propaganda. To reject dehumanizing language. To remember that today’s victims could be anyone tomorrow.

Supporting displaced people is not charity.  
It is solidarity.  

Opposing persecution is not betrayal.  
It is conscience.  

And believing in justice, even when it feels difficult, is how change begins.

This is not a call for anger.  
It is a call for responsibility.  
And it is a call we can no longer ignore.
